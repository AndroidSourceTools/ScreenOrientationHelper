# ScreenOrientationHelper
Screen orientation event listener helper for activity

What this library using for?
===============================
Use onCofigurationChanged() doesn't works for detected screen orientation. That made configuration change doesn't works when user rotate the screen. So I build this library to solved the problem from screen orientation detection with better solution.
